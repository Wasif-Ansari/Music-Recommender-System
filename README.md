# Music-Recommender-System

Recommendation systems represent a cornerstone in the field of machine learning, playing a pivotal role in predicting user preferences and ratings for various items, such as films, products, or songs.

**Content-based methods** are computationally fast and interpretable. Moreover, they can be efficiently adapted to new items or users.Â 
However, one of the biggest limitations of content-based recommendation systems is that the model only learns to recommend items of the same type that the user is already using or, in our case, listening to. Even though this could be helpful, the value of that recommendation is significantly less because it lacks the surprise component of discovering something completely new.
